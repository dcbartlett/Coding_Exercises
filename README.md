# Coding Challenges

The list below are coding challenges you should familiarize yourself with.  These are a great way to learn software engineering principals, and will most likely be used by companies to test your skills.

Each challenge links to it's own folder, which has a README describing the challenge, and a JS file with a solution.  A blog entry may accompany these challenges and will be linked in the cooresponding README.

Below are a list of completed or current challenges:
| No. | Challenge |
| --- | --------- |
|1    | [Two Sum](Solutions/1.%20TWO_SUM.md) |
|2    | [Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](Solutions/2.%20LONGEST_SUBSTRING_WITHOUT_REPEATING_CHARACTERS.md) |
