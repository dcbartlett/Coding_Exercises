# Challenge
You are given a large integer represented as an integer array digits, where each digits[i] is
the ith digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant
in left-to-right order. The large integer does not contain any leading 0's.

Increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.

Example 1:
```
Input: digits = [1,2,3]
Output: [1,2,4]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 123.
Incrementing by one gives 123 + 1 = 124.
Thus, the result should be [1,2,4].
```
Example 2:
```
Input: digits = [4,3,2,1]
Output: [4,3,2,2]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 4321.
Incrementing by one gives 4321 + 1 = 4322.
Thus, the result should be [4,3,2,2].
```
Example 3:
```
Input: digits = [9]
Output: [1,0]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 9.
Incrementing by one gives 9 + 1 = 10.
Thus, the result should be [1,0].
```

Constraints:

1 <= digits.length <= 100
0 <= digits[i] <= 9
digits does not contain any leading 0's.

# Evaluation
### Inputs

We are given a single input, an array of integers.<br>

### Constraints

We know that the length of digits array will be between 1 and 100 (inclusive).<br>
We know that any single digit will be between 0 and 9.<br>
We know that the array will not have a 0 in the first index.

### Initial Thoughts

Turn the digits array into an integer, add one, then turn it back into an array of integers.

# Approach

First we will joing the digits into a string.

We will then convert that string into a BigInt, handling any case where the integer is to large
for number type.

Next we will add BigInt 1 to the previous BigInt.

Finally we coherce the number into a string again and split it.  We return this.


# Complexity

|        |               |
| ------ | ------------- |
| Time:  | $$O(n)$$      |
| Space: | $$O(n)$$      |

# Code

### Javascript:
```js
/**
 * Echos out what you put in.
 * Runs at o(n)
 * @param {number[]} digits
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var plusOne = function(digits) {
    var numString = digits.join('');
    var numInt = BigInt(numString);
    var plusOne = numInt+BigInt(1);
    return (''+plusOne).split('')
};
```
