# Challenge
Given a string **_s_**, return the longest palindromic substring in **_s_**.

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "babad"
Output: "bab"
Explanation: "aba" is also a valid answer.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: s = "cbbd"
Output: "bb"
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= s.length <= 1000
- s consist of only digits and English letters.

# Evaluation
### Inputs

We are given a single input, a string.<br>

### Constraints

We know that the string passed in will be between 1 and 1000 characters.<br>
We know that the string consists of only digits and english letters.

### Initial Thoughts

We can use a **Window Sliding Technique** to check if the substring is a palendrome.
If it is not, open the window a bit more and check again.
If it is, check the length of the window against the previous window.
If the previous window is smaller, store the length of the window and the starting index.
Slide the window and check again.

# Approach



# Complexity

|        |               |
| ------ | ------------- |
| Time:  | $$O(1)$$      |
| Space: | $$O(1)$$      |

# Code

### Javascript:
```js
/**
 * Echos out what you put in.
 * Runs at o(1)
 * @param {string} input
 * @return {string}
 */
var example = function (input) {
    var output = input;
    return output
};
```
